# üé¨ Movie Dataset Web API - Group 2

This repository hosts our **Dataset Web API** project for TCSS 460.  
Our dataset focuses on movies from the last 30 years, and this API will allow users to view, search, and analyze information such as titles, genres, directors, and release years.

## Getting Started
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev` for local
- Environment: `PORT=3000`

## Importing Movie Data
To load your CSV data into the database, run:

```powershell
# Example: import movies from CSV (run from project root)
psql -h localhost -U <youruser> -d <yourdb> -c "\copy movie(title, release_year, runtime_minutes, rating, box_office, director_id, country_id) FROM './data/movies_last30years.csv' CSV HEADER;"

```
Replace `<youruser>` and `<yourdb>` with your Postgres username and database name. The column list must match your CSV header.

## Endpoints
- `GET /api/hello` ‚Äì sanity check
- See `/project_files/openapi.yaml` for full design.
