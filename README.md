# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Dataset Web API - Group 2

This repository hosts our **Dataset Web API** project for TCSS 460.  
Our dataset focuses on movies from the last 30 years, and this API will allow users to view, search, and analyze information such as titles, genres, directors, and release years.

## Getting Started
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev` for local
- Environment: `PORT=3000`

## Importing Movie Data
To load your CSV data into the database, run:

```powershell
# Example: import movies from CSV (run from project root)
psql -h localhost -U <youruser> -d <yourdb> -c "\copy movie(title, release_year, runtime_minutes, rating, box_office, director_id, country_id) FROM './data/movies_last30years.csv' CSV HEADER;"
```
Replace `<youruser>` and `<yourdb>` with your Postgres username and database name. The column list must match your CSV header.

## Endpoints
- `GET /api/hello` â€“ sanity check
- See `/project_files/openapi.yaml` for full design.

# Published Web API version Beta

## Hosted Web API (URLs)
- **Hello (sanity):** https://dataset-webapi-group2-1.onrender.com/api/hello  
- **Movies by Year (DB-backed):** https://dataset-webapi-group2-1.onrender.com/api/v1/moviebyyear?year=2023  
  > Change `year` to any valid year to see different results.

## Alpha Sprint Contribution
- **Primitivo Bambao** â€” Implemented the **DB-backed route** `/api/v1/moviebyyear`, wrote SQL/queries, and paired on Render environment configuration and query-parameter handling.
- **Jakita Kaur** â€” Co-led Render troubleshooting (env variables, connection string, port), verified the route end-to-end, **updated README**, and prepared the final submission.  
- **Evan Tran** â€” Wrote and refined the **hosted API docs** (Swagger at `/api-docs`) for currently implemented routes.
- **George Njane** â€” Built the **Postman collection** and tests covering `moviebyyear` (valid/invalid years) and `hello`.  

### 10/15, 10:00PMâ€“10:52PM (Discord call â€” all members)
- **Where/How:** 52-minute voice call on Discord.
- **What we did:** 
  - Opened the assignment and reviewed the new sprint requirements line by line.
  - Agreed that our database must live in the cloud (not local) and that we need at least one route that **queries the DB** and returns **variable results**.
  - Chose **Render** for both hosting the API and hosting **Managed PostgreSQL** so everything is in one place.
  - Defined the simple DB-backed route: `GET /api/v1/moviebyyear?year={YYYY}`.
  - Listed needed environment variables (`PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`) and decided to store them in Render.
- **Action items:**
  - Primitivo: write the DB query and wire it to the route.
  - Jakita: set up the Render service and env vars.
  - George: start a Postman collection.
  - Evan: update Swagger `/api-docs` for the routes we actually have.

### 10/17, 4:00PMâ€“4:47PM (Discord call â€” all members)
- **Where/How:** 47-minute voice call on Discord.
- **What we did:** 
  - Quick status check on each task (DB setup, route, docs, tests).
  - Verified the API boots on Render and the **hello** route responds.
  - Confirmed the database schema and connection string format.
  - Reviewed early Postman tests and Swagger entries for accuracy.
- **Action items:** 
  - Primitivo + Jakita: finish connecting the route to the live DB on Render.
  - George: expand Postman tests (valid/invalid years).
  - Evan: refine `/api-docs` examples to match current responses.

### 10/19, 9:00AMâ€“10:35 AM (Discord call â€” all members)
- **Where/How:** 95-minute voice call on Discord.
- **What we did:** 
  - Troubleshot **Render â†” PostgreSQL** connection (checked `DATABASE_URL`, SSL settings, and `PORT`).
  - Confirmed the **DB-backed route** works end-to-end:
    - Example: `GET /api/v1/moviebyyear?year=2023` returns a **list** of movies for 2023.
    - Tested multiple years to confirm results change with the input.
  - Finalized what goes in the README and what gets submitted.

## Beta Sprint Comments
- None:)
